                        <h1>OUR TARGET CUSTOMERS</h1>
                       <p>
                        Private airline operators(SpeciaI Flights) and commercial airlines are our target market. 
                        Segmenting these markets into groups enable us craft messages specifically for them. Also, 
                        this helps us to connect and develop relationships with them, and also communicate 
                        messages that resonate. In order for all these to happen, we segment our target market into 
                        geographic and psychographic segmentation. 
                        Under the geographic segmentation, our messages target customers in every comer of the 
                        world who have interest or plans to operate an aircraft in our region or airport in which we 
                        work. 
                        Under the Psychographic segmentation, we craft messages intended to lure the attention of 
                        a market on principles such as social class, life style and personality. Thus we handle 
                        aircraft that conveys VIP's to our airport of presence. 
                        Currently, we are opportune to handle private or chattered aircrafts that convey either cargo 
                        or personalities. Now we are targeting to outsource two or more commercial airlines. 
                        The unique value proposition for my target market is as follows: 
                        INTERTROPIC HOLDING is an all inclusive service provider established and run by 
                        experience aviation personnel to fill the critical gap that exist in this highly technical industry 
                        which is fast developing in Africa. 
                        We also partner with renowned aviation service providers worldwide. And we aim to improve 
                        our customers operational and business performance. This may be through improving 
                        safety, and reducing cost.

                      <div class="target-info">
                        <h1>THE MARKET AND COMPETITION</h1>
                       <p>
                        When we started initially, our market/industry had a small number of 
                        handlers/competitors, so therefore we were rewarded with long term contracts 
                        with price reduction. This was because the market was driven by demand and 
                        airlines or aircraft operators exploited their growing negotiating power to 
                        strengthen the commitment of handlers. As the market grew bigger, airlines 
                        prefer to discuss contracts more often to take advantage of the competitive 
                        pressure and reduce their handling cost even further. 
                        One of my successful factors over our competitors is our competitive cost 
                        structure over them. We also have lean and short decision process as well as a 
                        very strong customer orientation. 
                        
                        
                       </p>

                            <h1>PROGRESS AND COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION</h1>
                           <p>
                            In our region, the percentage of ground handling is expected to grow as more 
                            airlines seek to realise the benefit of outsourcing various operational tasks 
                            required on the ground. 
                            My business is registered and licensed with and by the Civil Aviation 
                            Authority(CAA). We have begun operation and we have been solicited by few and 
                            smaller airline operators in Europe, America, Africa and Asia who request us to 
                            handle their various aircrafts when they operates in the airport in which we work. 
                            Unfortunately, these are airline companies who operates into our region once or 
                            twice every month. This is why i anticipate to revamp my business in Guinea 
                            where there is a pending potential of a larger market.

            <h2>INNOVATION: What makes the business Novel?</h2>
            <p>Emotion is what makes our services unique. Our customers are emotionally connected to us 
                as we are delivering enough good services to win their trust. we understand that there are 
                common questions that pop up in their minds each time we send them introductory 
                messages. Questions such as: WHY SHOULD WE TRUST YOU?, WHY SHOULD WE 
                WORK WITH YOU?, DO you HAVE EXPERTISE IN WORK THAT WE ARE EXPECTING? 
                In this regard, we always try to build a strategy for client acquisition. We have a well thought 
                out unique selling proposition (USP) which distinguish us from other businesses in this 
                category. 
                Another reason why our services are unique is the fact that our customers (Flight Operators) 
                rely on us in providing them prompt and accurate information regarding quotation request 
                and NOTAMS which may occur/affect their pending operation in our airport of presence. 
                Often, we provide them discounts in our handling and supervision fees. We also negotiate 
                with the airport authorities on their behalf to minimise or waive some airport charges which 
                may seem irrelevant. 
                we also have a mutual relationship with the operations department of the airport; thus, this in 
                turn provide us the opportunity to obtain all necessary supporting documents required by our 
                customers before a flight depart. This is a very rare occurrence for our competitors..
